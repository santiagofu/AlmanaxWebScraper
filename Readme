This web scraper can be used to collect all mission descriptions from the Dofus almanax website.

Edit the code to select your language, change "es" to your language, for example "en" or "fr":
  String web = "https://www.krosmoz.com/es/almanax/";

Then create a txt file and put it on a certain location, for example:
  String path = "c:\\almanax.txt";
 
You can also change the game, edit the code to "dofus" or "wakfu" or "dofustouch" or "all":
  String game = "?game=dofus";
  
Run the code and enjoy.
